## CodeLabs 👩‍💻
### Write your first Flutter app, part 1
Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. In part one, you’ll use a package that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into an infinite scrolling list. You can also find this codelab on flutter.dev.
[Part-1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/#0)
### Write your first Flutter app, part 2
Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. In part two, you’ll extend the example from part 1 to allow the user to select favorite word pairs, and add a second “Saved Favorites” page where users can view the selected names. Finally, you’ll change the app’s theme color.
